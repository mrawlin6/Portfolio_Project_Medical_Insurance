    "In this project I will be using my python fundamentals and skills to look over a medical insurance costs dataset. The goal of this project is to first begin understanding what are good buisness questions and what questions can be answered through this dataset. My second goal for this project is to use these buisness questions to guide me through my data exploration. Lastly, doing some predictions using the data in relation to the questions that I choose to answer."
